    # ⚠️ FIX: REMOVING the 'defaults' block and setting 'working-directory' EXPLICITLY on every step.

    steps:
      # 1️⃣ Checkout repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2️⃣ Diagnostic Step: Verify directory structure (CRITICAL: Look at the output of this step!)
      - name: Show repository file structure
        # This shows the exact folder names and casing in your repository.
        # Ensure the output shows 'frontend' exactly as written.
        run: ls -R
        working-directory: ${{ github.workspace }}
        shell: bash

      # 3️⃣ Setup Node.js
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18

      # 4️⃣ Install dependencies (Now EXPLICITLY set to 'frontend')
      - name: Install Frontend dependencies
        run: npm install
        working-directory: frontend # <-- Explicitly forcing the path here

      # 5️⃣ Run Unit Tests for Login (Now EXPLICITLY set to 'frontend')
      - name: Run Login Unit Tests
        run: |
          npm test -- --testPathPattern=Login --watchAll=false --json --outputFile=unit-test-result.json
        working-directory: frontend # <-- Explicitly forcing the path here

      # 6️⃣ & 7️⃣ Run E2E Tests with Cypress
      - name: Run Login E2E Tests
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v6
        with:
          start: npm start
          wait-on: 'http://localhost:3000'
          spec: 'cypress/e2e/login.e2e.spec.js'
          working-directory: frontend # <-- Already explicit

      # 8️⃣ Upload test reports as artifacts
      # Paths here must be relative to the repository root.
      - name: Upload Test Reports
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: login-test-reports
